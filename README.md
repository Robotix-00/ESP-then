# ESP-then
> **STATUS**: WIP, currently not usable

ESP-then is a rust implementation of the ESP-now wireless protocol for microcontrollers (like the ESP32)

## DISCLAIMER!
i have no idea what I'm doing, it all might break, pls dont rely on my work to hard.

## Issues
- radiotap header differs when using different network interfaces
- high packet loss (approx. 1/5)
